# Template for Metric
[The metrics template](./template.md) is a draft for the template that all 'Metric Detail' pages can follow.

## Instructions

To create a new 'Metric Detail' page follow these steps:

  - In the __[metrics list](../activity-metrics-list.md)__, convert the name of a metric into a link
    - The link looks like this: `__[Name of Metric](activity-metrics/name-of-metric.md)__`.
  - Copy the text below the horizontal bar into the new wiki page.
  - Remove explanations in all sections and leave sections empty if no information is available at the moment.
    - **Important:** Do not delete a section heading because we want all 'Metric Detail' pages to be structured the same.
# {Metric Name}

## Naming 
In cases where the metric name is also a descriptor, please use this convention:

"specific thing being measured"-"further description if needed"

EX: pull-requests-open.md
EX: issues-first-response.md
